# PartnerWise.io - Full Stack SaaS
PartnerWise is a discovery tool used by over 4,800 content creators ranging from microinfluencers to influencers with over 500k followers. 

[Launched in Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/partnerwise#partnerwise) in August 2023, PartnerWise earns revenue through monthly subscriptions.

With my experience as a merchant in e-commerce for over 5+ years now, I recognized the current problem the market has for creators to find and grow partnerships with brands. There are not enough platforms that effectively grant creators with a resource of discovering new potential collaborations. PartnerWise serves this market and constantly reiterates the platform and features based on their feedback. 

As this is a very young product, it's very much still in its infancy stage. Functionality is prioritized with the creator's experience in mind.

**Building this product from scratch, frontend, backend, data storage, and more, has provided me with a priceless perspective on decision making and the importance of writing effective code that is used by real people.**
